Synthesize the DepMap and Enrichr results, evaluate whether the combined perturbation of these genes is likely to induce a significant effect on cell viability, and find literature support if exist."
PARP3,POLE,MCF10A,non-sl,We have engineered a double mutation in PARP3 and POLE in the MCF10A cell line.
