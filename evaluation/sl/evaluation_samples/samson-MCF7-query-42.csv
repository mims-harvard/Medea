Next, perform pathway enrichment analysis with Enrichr to identify whether pathways associated with cell viability are significantly enriched and could be impacted by the gene pair. Synthesize the DepMap and Enrichr results, evaluate whether the combined perturbation of these genes is likely to induce a significant effect on cell viability, and find literature support if exist."
